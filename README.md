Keep track of your clock-in and clock-outs from work.

## Motivation
Currently my work offers a terrible website to allow employees to check their
clock-ins, clock-outs, worked hours and overtime done. The problem starts with
the fact that it frequently incorrectly calculates worked hours. Besides that,
the platform has zero flexibility for people who work on flexible schedules.

That said, the idea here is to implement a simple to use, and initially very basic,
web page that calculates how many hours you worked in a day and present it, alongside
arrival and departure times from work, in a clean manner.

Also I wanted to learn WebComponents.

## Planned features
- [ ] Add arrival and departure hour for the day
- [ ] Calculate worked hours
- [ ] Display this information in a clean timeline
- [ ] Multiple days
- [ ] Add input for rest hours
- [ ] Add custom value multiplier to hour in certain ranges
