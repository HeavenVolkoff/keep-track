Keep track of your clock-in and clock-outs from work.

## Motivation

Currently, my work offers a terrible website to allow employees to check their
clock-ins, clock-outs, worked hours and overtime done. The problem starts with
the fact that it calculates worked hours incorrectly most of the time. Besides
that, the platform has zero flexibility for people who work on flexible schedules.

That said, the idea here is to implement an extensible, simple to use, and
initially very basic web page that calculates how many hours you worked and
present it, alongside arrival and departure times.

Also, I wanted to learn WebComponents.

## Planned features

- [ ] Add input for arrival and departure hour
- [ ] Calculate worked hours
- [ ] Display this information in a clean timeline
- [ ] Implement multiple days
- [ ] Implement local saving
- [ ] Add input for rest hours
- [ ] Add custom value multiplier to hour in certain ranges
- [ ] Implement ServiceWorker
